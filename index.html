                                Welcome! My name is Rain Holloway and I am an undergraduate studying the Bachelor of Computing Science with a major in AI and Data
                                Analytics. Computer science has always been a big component of my life, even though prior to studying IT based subjects in high school
                                I didn't realize that yet. I'm a big believer that computer science has one of the biggest impacts in humanity's progression through
                                existence, allowing communication, entertainment, exploration, research, and opportunities for students like us. Anyway, disregarding my
                                philosophical discussion, with this website, I aim to provide viewers, like yourself, with an understanding into my hobbyist life
                                as well as, and predominantly, my involvement with computer science throughout my life. Check out this cute of pic me:

                    Recently, I have been overly interested in fermentation, more so the art of Kombucha. Now hold on a minute, this does have relevance to 
                    computer science, you just have to get some nice contextual background info. Kombucha involves fermenting very sweet tea with the presence
                    of a SCOBY (Symbiotic Community Of Bacteria and Yeast). Whenever I get free time, I usually enjoy reading people's posts on the Kombucha
                    subreddit flaming noobs for posting the same questions all the time, what a lovely community I must say. However, I have also been
                    slowly developing a GUI application in Java with the JavaFX framework to benefit my kombucha brewing activity. It's been a nice learning curve, based all of my program off of
                    OOP principles and design so I think I'm pretty well off in terms of scalability. The app is based around keeping track of every active
                    batch of kombucha you have lying around and organizing any important information along with it using JSON and Google's annoying GSON library.
